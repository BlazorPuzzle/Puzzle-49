### The Challenge:

This is a simple Blazor Web App with Global Server Interactivity.

We have an edit form for a simple model with two data annotations for validation.

What if we want to do some custom validation: for example, we want to **not allow** submitting if the name contains the string "Java" with case-insensitivity.

How can we do that?
